# Numbers

```
This program reads numbers from the console,
outputs them in different formats and writes them into a file.
```


## Installation
```
The project can be started in any java environment,
it consists of three java files.

* open a new project.
* copy the project folder: ProgNumbers into your java environment. 
* run the Numbers file.

- Numbers.java - contains the main
- FileHandler.java - writes a short number array into a text file
- ShortNumbers.java - produces ShortNumber objects
```


## Usage

```
You can produce a short number array by entering numbers in to the console.

* enter a positive integer to choose the amount of numbers you want to work with.
* enter the the right amount of positive integer numbers.
* choose how many numbers per line you want to see on the console.

 The array is then printed on the console; manipulated and formated in different ways
 and written into a text file. 

* enter a path, relative or absolute to determine were you want to save the text file,
* give a name to the text file that contains the array.
